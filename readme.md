    CrossDevice.App.<property>
    CrossDevice.PowerState.<property>
    CrossDevice.Network.<property>

## FAQ

1. DeviceId is coming back null
* Follow permission setting as listed above

2. I'm getting "Platform implementation not supported"
* Ensure you have installed the nuget package on your actual application project

3. UWP battery implementation doesn't do anything
* I haven't been able to find a way to support this yet

4. The DeviceId changes if I uninstall my app from the phone
* There isn't a "static" ID on an iphone that really works.  I use IdentifierForVendor()
